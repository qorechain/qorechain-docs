# BTC Restaking (Babylon)

The `x/babylon` module integrates QoreChain with the Babylon Protocol to inherit Bitcoin's proof-of-work finality guarantees. Through BTC restaking, QoreChain gains a secondary finality layer backed by Bitcoin's hashrate — without requiring any changes to the Bitcoin protocol itself.

## Overview

Babylon Protocol enables proof-of-stake chains to leverage Bitcoin's security through a timestamping and checkpointing mechanism. QoreChain's integration works as follows:

1. **BTC stakers** lock Bitcoin in Babylon staking transactions and register their positions on QoreChain.
2. **Epoch checkpoints** from QoreChain are periodically relayed to Babylon, which timestamps them on Bitcoin.
3. **Finality inheritance**: Once a QoreChain epoch is checkpointed on Bitcoin, the state covered by that epoch inherits Bitcoin's proof-of-work finality guarantees.

This provides a defense against long-range attacks and equivocation that is anchored to Bitcoin's accumulated hashrate rather than relying solely on QoreChain's own validator set.

## BTC Staking Positions

Users can register BTC staking positions on QoreChain by submitting a `MsgBTCRestake` transaction that references a Bitcoin staking transaction.

### Registration Requirements

| Parameter               | Value                        | Description                                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Minimum stake**       | 100,000 satoshis (0.001 BTC) | Minimum BTC required per staking position         |
| **Unbonding period**    | 144 BTC blocks (\~1 day)     | Waiting period before staked BTC can be withdrawn |
| **Checkpoint interval** | Every 10 QoreChain epochs    | How often state is checkpointed to Babylon        |

### Staking Position Structure

Each BTC staking position tracks the following on-chain state:

| Field              | Description                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `staker_address`   | QoreChain address of the staker (`qor1...`)                     |
| `btc_tx_hash`      | Bitcoin transaction hash of the staking transaction             |
| `amount_satoshis`  | Amount of BTC staked in satoshis                                |
| `status`           | Position lifecycle state: `active`, `unbonding`, or `withdrawn` |
| `staked_at`        | Timestamp of position registration                              |
| `unbonding_height` | Block height at which unbonding was initiated (if applicable)   |
| `validator_addr`   | QoreChain validator address this stake is delegated to          |

### Registration Flow

1. **Create BTC staking transaction** — On the Bitcoin network, create the BTC staking transaction.
2. **Submit MsgBTCRestake on QoreChain** — On QoreChain, submit `MsgBTCRestake` with `btc_tx_hash`, `amount`, and `validator`.
3. **Position recorded** — The position is recorded on-chain as "active".

## Epoch Checkpoints

QoreChain's epoch state roots are periodically checkpointed to Bitcoin through the Babylon relay chain.

### Checkpoint Flow

1. **Submit checkpoint** — A QoreChain validator submits `MsgSubmitBTCCheckpoint` containing the epoch number, BTC block hash, BTC block height, and QoreChain state root.
2. **IBC relay** — The checkpoint data is relayed to the Babylon chain via IBC.
3. **Timestamping on Bitcoin** — Babylon includes the checkpoint in a Bitcoin transaction, anchoring QoreChain's state to Bitcoin's blockchain.
4. **Confirmation** — Once the Bitcoin transaction is confirmed, finality flows back through Babylon to QoreChain.
5. **Finalization** — The checkpoint status transitions from `pending` to `confirmed` to `finalized`.

### Checkpoint Structure

| Field              | Description                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `epoch_num`        | QoreChain epoch number being checkpointed                |
| `btc_block_hash`   | Bitcoin block hash containing the checkpoint             |
| `btc_block_height` | Bitcoin block height                                     |
| `state_root`       | QoreChain state root at the epoch boundary               |
| `submitted_at`     | Timestamp of checkpoint submission                       |
| `status`           | Checkpoint state: `pending`, `confirmed`, or `finalized` |

### Epoch Snapshots

At each checkpoint boundary, an epoch snapshot captures aggregate network state:

| Field              | Description                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `total_staked`     | Total BTC staked across all positions (satoshis) |
| `active_positions` | Number of active staking positions               |
| `validator_count`  | Number of validators with BTC-backed delegations |
| `block_height`     | QoreChain block height at snapshot               |

## Secondary Finality Layer

The Babylon integration provides a **secondary finality guarantee** that complements QoreChain's native consensus finality:

| Finality Layer | Source                     | Speed        | Security                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Primary**    | QoreChain Consensus Engine | \~5 seconds  | Backed by QOR stake + PQC signatures    |
| **Secondary**  | Babylon + Bitcoin          | \~60 minutes | Backed by Bitcoin's cumulative hashrate |

The secondary layer is particularly valuable for:

* **Long-range attack prevention**: Even if an attacker accumulates significant QOR stake, they cannot rewrite history that has been checkpointed on Bitcoin.
* **Cross-chain bridge security**: Bridge operations involving large values can wait for Bitcoin-level finality before releasing funds.
* **Institutional confidence**: The Bitcoin timestamp provides an independently verifiable proof of QoreChain's state history.
