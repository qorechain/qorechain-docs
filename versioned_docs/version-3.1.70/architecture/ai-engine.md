# AI Engine

QoreChain integrates AI capabilities at multiple levels of the protocol stack through the `x/ai` module. The on-chain layer provides deterministic heuristic-based analysis suitable for consensus-critical operations, while an off-chain sidecar extends capabilities with deep learning models for advisory and developer tooling.

## Three-Layer Architecture

The QCAI (QoreChain AI) engine operates across three layers:

| Layer                 | Scope                                                  | Execution                | Deterministic |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| **Consensus Level**   | Block production, parameter tuning                     | On-chain (x/rlconsensus) | Yes           |
| **Network Level**     | Transaction routing, fraud detection, fee optimization | On-chain (x/ai)          | Yes           |
| **Application Level** | Contract generation, auditing, deep analysis           | Off-chain (sidecar)      | No            |

The consensus level is documented separately in the [PRISM Consensus Engine](/architecture/prism-consensus-engine). This page covers the network and application levels.

## Transaction Router

The AI-enhanced router selects optimal validators and routes for each transaction using weighted multi-factor scoring.

### Optimization Formula

```
OptimalRoute = argmin_r( alpha * Latency(r) + beta * Cost(r) + gamma * Security(r)^-1 )
```

| Weight   | Symbol | Default | Description                                                                      |
| -------- | ------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Latency  | alpha  | 0.4     | Normalized response time (0=best, 1=worst). 0ms maps to 0.0, 1000ms maps to 1.0. |
| Cost     | beta   | 0.3     | Current load percentage as a proxy for cost.                                     |
| Security | gamma  | 0.3     | Inverse of reputation score. Higher reputation yields a lower (better) score.    |

The router maintains a **metrics cache** (default TTL: 30 seconds) with per-validator performance data including average latency, uptime percentage, load percentage, and reputation score. When cached metrics are unavailable, the system falls back to the heuristic router.

### Routing Confidence

Confidence scales with the number of validators with available metrics:

| Validators with Metrics | Confidence |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| >= 10                   | 0.95       |
| >= 5                    | 0.85       |
| >= 2                    | 0.75       |
| 1                       | 0.60       |

## Fraud Detection

The fraud detector implements a **six-layer detection pipeline** that analyzes each transaction against recent history using statistical methods.

### Detection Layers

| Layer | Detector                | Method                                                                | Trigger Threshold                                          |
| ----- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | **Isolation Forest**    | Statistical Z-score across amount, gas, and sender frequency features | Anomaly score > 0.7                                        |
| 2     | **Sequence Analyzer**   | Detects alternating send/receive patterns (wash trading)              | > 3 alternating transfers between same pair                |
| 3     | **Sybil Detector**      | Tracks new unique addresses; flags spikes in new senders              | > 30% of recent transactions from new addresses            |
| 4     | **DDoS Detector**       | Monitors per-sender transaction frequency                             | > 100 transactions per minute from a single sender         |
| 5     | **Flash Loan Detector** | Identifies borrow-manipulate-repay patterns within a single block     | >= 3 transactions in same block with > 10x amount variance |
| 6     | **Exploit Detector**    | Flags abnormal gas consumption in contract calls                      | > 5x average gas for the same transaction type             |

### Threat Classification

| Confidence Range | Threat Level |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| >= 0.9           | Critical     |
| >= 0.7           | High         |
| >= 0.5           | Medium       |
| >= 0.3           | Low          |
| &lt; 0.3         | None         |

### Response Actions

| Threat Level | Confidence | Action                                                       |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Critical     | > 0.8      | `circuit_break` — Pause specific contract executions         |
| Critical     | &lt;= 0.8  | `rate_limit` — Temporarily reduce TX acceptance from source  |
| High         | > 0.7      | `rate_limit`                                                 |
| High         | &lt;= 0.7  | `alert` — Emit event for validators and operators            |
| Medium       | Any        | `alert`                                                      |
| Low / None   | Any        | `allow`                                                      |

When an action other than `allow` is triggered, a fraud investigation record is created with a unique ID (format: `INV-{timestamp}-{txhash_prefix}`).

## Fee Optimizer

The fee optimizer predicts network congestion and suggests optimal fees for desired confirmation times using exponential moving average (EMA) congestion tracking.

### Congestion Prediction

* **EMA smoothing factor (alpha)**: 0.2
* **History window**: 100 blocks
* **Trend analysis**: Compares the most recent 5 blocks against the prior 5 blocks to detect congestion trends, then projects forward with 50% dampening.

### Urgency Tiers

| Urgency  | Base Multiplier | Estimated Confirmation |
| -------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| `fast`   | 2.0x            | 1-2 blocks             |
| `normal` | 1.0x            | 3-5 blocks             |
| `slow`   | 0.5x            | 6-10 blocks            |

The final fee incorporates a **congestion multiplier** (1.0x at 0% congestion, up to 5.0x at 100% congestion) and a **trend premium** when predicted congestion exceeds current congestion. The minimum fee floor is 500 uqor (0.0005 QOR).

## Network Optimizer

The network optimizer continuously monitors performance metrics and generates governance parameter recommendations using a multi-objective reward function.

### Reward Function

```
R(s, a, s') = alpha * DeltaPerformance + beta * DeltaLatency + gamma * DeltaEnergy - delta * StabilityPenalty
```

| Weight | Value | Objective               |
| ------ | ----- | ----------------------- |
| alpha  | 0.35  | Performance improvement |
| beta   | 0.30  | Latency reduction       |
| gamma  | 0.15  | Energy/resource savings |
| delta  | 0.20  | Stability preservation  |

### Recommendation Types

The optimizer generates recommendations for:

* **Block gas limit**: Increase when utilization > 80%, decrease when &lt; 20%
* **Minimum commission rate**: Lower when validator count is below 5
* **Maximum validators**: Increase when block times are healthy and >= 10 validators active
* **Block time target**: Alert when average block time exceeds 8 seconds

Each recommendation includes the current value, suggested value, expected impact, confidence score, and reasoning.

## AI Sidecar

The QCAI Sidecar extends on-chain AI with off-chain deep learning models backed by the QCAI Backend. The sidecar is optional and non-consensus-critical, and is reached over an internal gRPC interface.

### Capabilities

| Capability              | Description                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Contract Generation** | Generates smart contracts from natural language specifications across 17 platforms  |
| **Contract Auditing**   | Deep security analysis of smart contract code                                       |
| **Deep Fraud Analysis** | Extended fraud investigation using trained models (supplements on-chain heuristics) |
| **Network Advice**      | Advanced parameter optimization recommendations                                     |

### Models

| Model Name    | Use Case                                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| QCAI Fast     | Low-latency responses for fee estimation and routing |
| QCAI Balanced | Deeper analysis for auditing and fraud investigation |

The sidecar runs as an independent off-chain service so that deep-learning workloads never block or influence consensus-critical execution.

## EVM Precompiles

Two precompiled contracts expose on-chain AI capabilities to EVM smart contracts:

| Precompile       | Address  | Description                                                           |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aiRiskScore`    | `0x0B01` | Returns a risk score (0-100) for a given address or transaction hash  |
| `aiAnomalyCheck` | `0x0B02` | Returns a boolean anomaly flag and confidence score for a transaction |

**Important**: EVM precompiles use the **deterministic heuristic engine only**. They never call the sidecar, ensuring all EVM execution remains fully deterministic and reproducible.

## TEE Attestation

The AI module defines interfaces for **Trusted Execution Environment** attestation, enabling future verifiable AI model execution inside secure hardware enclaves.

### Supported Platforms

| Platform    | Identifier | Description                                            |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Intel SGX   | `sgx`      | Software Guard Extensions                              |
| Intel TDX   | `tdx`      | Trust Domain Extensions                                |
| AMD SEV-SNP | `sev-snp`  | Secure Encrypted Virtualization - Secure Nested Paging |
| ARM CCA     | `arm-cca`  | Confidential Compute Architecture                      |

### Attestation Flow

1. **Load model weights** — The sidecar loads AI model weights into a TEE enclave.
2. **Run inference inside enclave** — Inference runs inside the enclave's protected memory.
3. **Produce attestation report** — The enclave produces an attestation report binding the model hash, input hash, and output hash.
4. **Verify attestation on-chain** — Validators verify the attestation on-chain before accepting inference results.

TEE attestation is currently at the interface specification stage. Implementation is planned for a future release.

## Federated Learning

The AI module defines interfaces for **on-chain federated learning** coordination, where validator nodes train local models and submit gradient updates that are aggregated into a global model without sharing raw training data.

### Aggregation Methods

| Method     | Description                                                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fedavg`   | Federated Averaging — weighted average of gradients by sample count     |
| `fedprox`  | Federated Proximal — adds a proximal term to handle heterogeneous data  |
| `scaffold` | SCAFFOLD — uses control variates to correct for client drift            |

### Round Lifecycle

```
Pending --> Training --> Aggregating --> Complete
                                    \-> Failed (timeout or insufficient participants)
```

Each round is configured with minimum/maximum participants, timeout, learning rate, gradient clipping norm, and an optional differential privacy noise multiplier. All gradient submissions are signed with PQC (Dilithium-5) signatures.

Federated learning is currently at the interface specification stage. Implementation is planned for a future release.

## REST Endpoints

| Endpoint                         | Description                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/ai/v1/fee-estimate`            | Returns fee estimates for fast, normal, and slow urgency tiers |
| `/ai/v1/fraud/investigations`    | Lists active and resolved fraud investigations                 |
| `/ai/v1/network/recommendations` | Returns current network parameter optimization recommendations |
