# PRISM Consensus Engine

QoreChain embeds **PRISM** (Policy-driven Reinforcement-learning for Intelligent State Machines), a reinforcement-learning optimization layer, directly into the consensus layer via the `x/rlconsensus` module. PRISM observes chain metrics every N blocks, runs inference through a fixed-point neural network, and proposes consensus parameter adjustments — all deterministically, with no floating-point arithmetic in consensus-critical paths.

---

## Architecture Overview

PRISM consists of four components:

1. **Observation Collector** — Gathers 25-dimensional chain state vectors at configurable intervals.
2. **Policy Network (MLP)** — A Go-native multi-layer perceptron that maps observations to actions.
3. **Reward Computer** — Evaluates the quality of parameter changes using a weighted multi-objective function.
4. **Circuit Breaker** — Monitors chain health and reverts all PRISM-tuned parameters if instability is detected.

All components operate within the ABCI lifecycle and produce deterministic, verifiable outputs across all validator nodes.

---

## Policy Network

The policy network is a feedforward multi-layer perceptron (MLP) implemented entirely in Go with **int64 fixed-point arithmetic** (scaled by 10^8).

### Network Architecture

| Property            | Value                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Input dimensions    | 25                                 |
| Hidden layers       | 2                                  |
| Hidden layer sizes  | 256, 256                           |
| Output dimensions   | 5                                  |
| Activation (hidden) | ReLU                               |
| Activation (output) | tanh                               |
| Total parameters    | 73,733                             |
| Precision           | int64 fixed-point (scaled by 10^8) |

### Parameter Count Breakdown

```
Layer 1: 25 * 256 + 256   =  6,656  (input -> hidden_1)
Layer 2: 256 * 256 + 256   = 65,792  (hidden_1 -> hidden_2)
Layer 3: 256 * 5 + 5       =  1,285  (hidden_2 -> output)
Total:                       73,733
```

### Fixed-Point Arithmetic

All MLP computations use `int64` values scaled by `FixedPointScale = 10^8`. This eliminates non-determinism from IEEE 754 floating-point rounding differences across hardware platforms.

* **Multiplication**: `fixMul(a, b) = (a / SCALE) * b + (a % SCALE) * b / SCALE` (split to prevent overflow)
* **ReLU**: `relu(x) = max(0, x)`
* **tanh**: Pade approximant `tanh(x) ~ x * (3*S - x^2) / (3*S + x^2)` for `|x| <= 2.5*SCALE`, clamped to +/- SCALE otherwise

Policy weights are stored on-chain as a flattened `[]int64` vector and can be updated via governance proposal.

## Observation Vector

PRISM collects a 25-dimensional observation vector at each observation interval (default: every 10 blocks).

| Index | Dimension              | Description                                      |

| 4     | `block_time_delta`     | Block time minus target block time (ms)          |
| 5     | `gas_price_50th`       | Median gas price                                 |

All values are stored as `LegacyDec` string representations and converted to int64 fixed-point before inference.

---

## Action Space

The MLP output is a 5-dimensional action vector, where each dimension represents a proposed change to a consensus parameter. The tanh activation constrains raw outputs to \[-1, 1], which are then scaled by mode-specific bounds.

| Index | Action Dimension           | Description                                                             |
| ----- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | `block_time_delta`         | Proposed change to target block time (ms)                               |
| 1     | `gas_price_delta`          | Proposed change to base gas price                                       |
| 2     | `validator_set_size_delta` | Proposed change to target validator set size (logged only, not applied) |
| 3     | `pool_weight_rpos_delta`   | Proposed change to RPoS pool priority weight                            |
| 4     | `pool_weight_dpos_delta`   | Proposed change to DPoS pool priority weight                            |

Actions are **clamped** to the maximum change bounds defined by the current PRISM mode before application.

## Reward Function

The reward signal evaluates how well recent parameter changes improved chain performance. It is computed as a weighted sum of five objectives:

```
R = 0.30 * delta_throughput
  + 0.25 * delta_finality
  + 0.20 * delta_decentralization
  - 0.15 * mev_estimate
  - 0.10 * failed_tx_ratio
```

| Component           | Weight | Direction | Source Metric                                 |
| ------------------- | ------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Throughput          | +0.30  | Maximize  | Change in block utilization                   |
| Finality            | +0.25  | Maximize  | Change in precommit ratio                     |
| Decentralization    | +0.20  | Maximize  | Negative change in validator Gini coefficient |
| MEV                 | -0.15  | Minimize  | Current MEV estimate                          |
| Failed Transactions | -0.10  | Minimize  | Current failed transaction ratio              |

The reward weights are governance-configurable and must sum to exactly 1.0.

## PRISM Modes

PRISM operates in one of four modes, controllable via governance:

| Mode             | ID | Max Change | Behavior                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | -- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Shadow**       | 0  | 0%         | Observe and log recommendations only. No parameters are changed. This is the default mode. |
| **Conservative** | 1  | +/- 10%    | Apply parameter changes within tight bounds. Suitable for initial live deployment.         |
| **Autonomous**   | 2  | +/- 25%    | Apply parameter changes within wider bounds. For mature networks with validated policies.  |
| **Paused**       | 3  | 0%         | PRISM is completely idle. No observations are collected and no inference runs.             |

Mode transitions require a governance proposal. The recommended deployment path is: Shadow → Conservative → Autonomous.

---

## Circuit Breaker

The circuit breaker is a safety mechanism that monitors chain health and automatically reverts all PRISM-tuned parameters if instability is detected.

### Detection Logic

The circuit breaker evaluates the last **50 blocks** (configurable via `circuit_breaker_window`):

1. **Compute block time deltas** — For each consecutive pair of block timestamps, compute the block time delta.
2. **Classify healthy blocks** — A block is considered **healthy** if its delta is positive and within 2x the target block time.
3. **Compute healthy fraction** — Compute the **healthy fraction** = healthy blocks / total deltas.

### Trigger Condition

If the healthy fraction falls below the threshold (default: **50%**), the circuit breaker triggers.

### Response

When triggered, the circuit breaker:

1. **Reverts** all PRISM-applied parameters (block time, gas price, pool weights) to their default values.
2. **Pauses** PRISM (sets `CircuitBreakerActive = true`).
3. **Clears** the in-memory policy to force a fresh reload.
4. **Emits** a `circuit_breaker_triggered` event.

The circuit breaker automatically clears when the healthy fraction recovers above the threshold on subsequent evaluations.

---

## Rollup Advisory Functions

PRISM provides advisory functions for rollup parameter optimization:

* **`SuggestRollupProfile`** — Analyzes current chain conditions and suggests optimal rollup configuration parameters (block time, gas limit, settlement frequency).
* **`OptimizeRollupGas`** — Recommends gas pricing adjustments for rollup settlement transactions based on main chain congestion patterns.

These functions are informational only and do not modify chain state.

---

## Deterministic Math Library

All PRISM calculations use the `mathutil` package, which provides deterministic alternatives to standard floating-point math:

| Function                  | Description                 | Method                                                    |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `IntegerSqrt(x)`          | Square root                 | Newton's method on `LegacyDec`, 100-iteration convergence |
| `TaylorLn1PlusX(x)`       | Natural logarithm `ln(1+x)` | Argument reduction + 15-term Taylor series                |
| `ExpApprox(x)`            | Exponential `e^x`           | 12-term Taylor series                                     |
| `SigmoidApprox(x)`        | Sigmoid `1/(1+e^-x)`        | `ExpApprox` with symmetry for negative inputs             |
| `ReputationMultiplier(r)` | Maps \[0,1] to \[0.5,2.0]   | Sigmoid with scale and offset                             |

All functions operate on `cosmossdk.io/math.LegacyDec` values, ensuring identical results across all hardware platforms and Go compiler versions.
