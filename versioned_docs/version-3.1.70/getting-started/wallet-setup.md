# Wallet Setup

QoreChain supports multiple wallet types across its native, EVM, and SVM execution environments. Choose the wallet that matches your use case.

:::note
The chain IDs and RPC endpoints below target the **`qorechain-diana`** testnet (EVM chain ID **9800**). Mainnet (**`qorechain-vladi`**, EVM chain ID **9801**) has been live since 7 June 2026; its wallet connection values are documented on the separate **Connecting to Mainnet** page.

## Keplr Wallet

Keplr is the recommended wallet for native QoreChain transactions, staking, and governance.

### Add QoreChain as a Custom Chain

Open Keplr and navigate to **Settings > Add Custom Chain**, then enter:

| Field              | Value                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Chain Name         | `QoreChain Diana Testnet` |
| Chain ID           | `qorechain-diana`         |
| RPC URL            | `http://localhost:26657`  |
| REST URL           | `http://localhost:1317`   |
| Bech32 Prefix      | `qor`                     |
| Coin Denom         | `QOR`                     |
| Coin Minimal Denom | `uqor`                    |
| Decimals           | `6`                       |

After adding the chain, Keplr generates a `qor1...` address for your account. Use this address to receive testnet QOR tokens.

## MetaMask (EVM)

MetaMask enables interaction with QoreChain's EVM execution environment — deploy Solidity contracts, manage ERC-20 tokens, and use familiar Ethereum tooling.

### Add QoreChain as a Custom Network

Open MetaMask and navigate to **Settings > Networks > Add Network**, then enter:

| Field           | Value                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Network Name    | `QoreChain EVM`         |
| RPC URL         | `http://localhost:8545` |
| Chain ID        | `9800`                  |
| Currency Symbol | `QOR`                   |

Once connected, you can use MetaMask to sign EVM transactions, interact with deployed smart contracts, and manage ERC-20 tokens on QoreChain.

## Solana Wallets (SVM)

QoreChain's SVM execution environment is compatible with standard Solana tooling. Connect any Solana-compatible wallet or library to interact with SVM programs.

### Using @solana/web3.js

```javascript
import { Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";

const connection = new Connection("http://localhost:8899");
const slot = await connection.getSlot();
console.log("Current slot:", slot);
```

This enables deployment and interaction with SVM programs running on QoreChain.

## PQC-Enabled Wallets

QoreChain features hybrid post-quantum cryptography (PQC) support through ML-DSA-87 (Dilithium-5) signatures. This provides quantum-resistant security alongside standard Ed25519 signatures.

### How It Works

Wallets can attach an ML-DSA-87 PQC signature as a transaction extension alongside the standard Ed25519 signature. This hybrid approach ensures backward compatibility while enabling quantum resistance.

### Auto-Registration

When you include a PQC public key in your first transaction, QoreChain automatically registers it on-chain. No separate registration step is needed.

### PQC Modes

| Mode                   | Description                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Disabled**           | PQC verification is turned off. Standard signatures only.               |
| **Optional** (default) | Transactions may include PQC signatures. If present, they are verified. |
| **Required**           | All transactions must include a valid PQC signature.                    |

The active mode is configured at the chain level and can be updated through governance.

## CLI Wallet

The `qorechaind` binary includes a built-in key management system for command-line usage.

### Create a New Key

```bash
qorechaind keys add mykey
```

This generates a new key pair and displays the mnemonic phrase. **Store the mnemonic securely** — it is the only way to recover this key.

### View Your Address

```bash
qorechaind keys show mykey -a
```

This outputs your `qor1...` bech32 address.

### List All Keys

```bash
qorechaind keys list
```

### Import an Existing Key

```bash
qorechaind keys add mykey --recover
```

You will be prompted to enter your mnemonic phrase.
