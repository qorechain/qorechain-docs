# Connecting to Testnet

Join the live QoreChain Diana testnet by configuring your node with the correct genesis file, peers, and network settings.

:::note
This page covers the **`qorechain-diana`** testnet (EVM chain ID **9800**). Mainnet (**`qorechain-vladi`**, EVM chain ID **9801**) has been live since 7 June 2026 and has its own dedicated **Connecting to Mainnet** page with separate genesis, peers, and connection details.
:::

## Download Genesis

Replace your local genesis file with the official testnet genesis:

```bash
curl -o ~/.qorechaind/config/genesis.json \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qorechain/qorechain-core/main/config/genesis.json
```

This file defines the initial state of the Diana testnet, including the validator set, token allocations, and module parameters.

---

## Configure Peers

Edit your node configuration to connect to existing testnet peers.

Open `~/.qorechaind/config/config.toml` and set the `persistent_peers` field:

```toml
persistent_peers = "node-id@seed1.qorechain.io:26656,node-id@seed2.qorechain.io:26656"
```

Refer to the [QoreChain repository](https://github.com/qorechain/qorechain-core) for the latest peer list.

### Recommended Settings

You may also want to adjust the following in `config.toml`:

```toml
[mempool]
size = 5000

[consensus]
timeout_propose = "3s"
timeout_commit = "5s"
```

These values are tuned for the Diana testnet's block times and throughput.

---

## Start Node

Launch your node to begin syncing with the network:

```bash
./qorechaind start
```

The node connects to peers and begins downloading blocks from genesis. Initial sync time depends on the current chain height and your network speed.

---

## Check Sync Status

Verify that your node is catching up to the latest block:

```bash
curl localhost:26657/status | jq '.result.sync_info.catching_up'
```

* `true` — The node is still syncing. Wait for it to catch up.
* `false` — The node is fully synced and processing new blocks.

You can also check the latest block height:

```bash
curl localhost:26657/status | jq '.result.sync_info.latest_block_height'
```

---

## Monitoring

QoreChain exposes several endpoints for monitoring node health and performance.

### Prometheus Metrics

Raw metrics are available at:

```
http://localhost:26660/metrics
```

These metrics can be scraped by any Prometheus-compatible collector.

### Grafana Dashboards

If running via Docker Compose, Grafana is available at:

```
http://localhost:3001
```

On first login, set your own credentials when prompted — do not leave the defaults in place. Pre-configured dashboards display block production, transaction throughput, peer connections, and resource usage.

### REST Health Check

The REST API provides a quick status endpoint:

```
http://localhost:1317
```
