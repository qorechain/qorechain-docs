# Glossary

Alphabetical reference of terms, abbreviations, and acronyms used throughout the QoreChain documentation.

---

**AMM** — Automated Market Maker. QoreChain's native on-chain liquidity module (`x/amm`) providing constant-product pools, swaps, and liquidity provisioning directly at the protocol level, without an external smart-contract deployment. See [AMM](/architecture/amm).

**BPF** — Berkeley Packet Filter. The bytecode format used by the SVM runtime to execute on-chain programs. Programs are compiled to BPF before deployment.

**Chain License** — An on-chain license record managed by the `x/license` module. Chain licenses gate access to specific protocol capabilities and let operators register, verify, and manage licensing entitlements on-chain. See [Chain Licensing](/architecture/chain-licensing).

**CLFB** — Cross-Layer Fee Balancing. A mechanism within the multilayer architecture that dynamically adjusts fees across sidechains and paychains to maintain equilibrium and prevent congestion on any single layer.

**CPI** — Cross-Program Invocation. A mechanism in the SVM runtime that allows one deployed program to call another program within the same transaction context.

**CPoS** — Classified Proof-of-Stake. QoreChain's consensus classification system that groups validators into three pools (Emerald, Sapphire, Ruby) based on reputation scores. Each pool has distinct weights in the proposer selection algorithm.

**DA** — Data Availability. The guarantee that transaction data published to the chain can be retrieved by any node. The RDK module provides native DA for rollups, storing blobs on-chain with configurable retention periods.

**DPoS** — Delegated Proof-of-Stake. A consensus mechanism where token holders delegate their stake to validators who produce blocks on their behalf. QoreChain extends DPoS with reputation-weighted classification (CPoS).

**EIP-1559** — Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559. A transaction fee model that uses a base fee (burned) plus a priority fee (paid to validators). QoreChain implements EIP-1559-style fee mechanics in its QoreChain EVM Engine.

**HCS** — Hybrid Cryptographic Signatures. QoreChain's dual-signature system where transactions carry both a classical signature (secp256k1/ECDSA) and a post-quantum signature (ML-DSA-87), providing cryptographic security against both classical and quantum adversaries.

**IBC** — Inter-Blockchain Communication. A protocol for authenticated message passing between independent blockchains. QoreChain supports IBC channels for cross-chain token transfers and data relay.

**Light Node** — A resource-light node that follows the chain and serves lightweight queries without holding full state. Light nodes receive a dedicated **3%** share of the protocol fee split, rewarding participants who extend network reachability. See [Light Node](/light-node/overview).

**MEV** — Maximal Extractable Value. The profit that can be obtained by reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions within a block. QoreChain's FairBlock module (tIBE encryption) and 5-lane TX prioritization mitigate MEV extraction.

**ML-DSA-87** — Module-Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm (security level 5). The NIST-standardized post-quantum digital signature scheme used by QoreChain for quantum-resistant transaction signing. Produces signatures of 4,627 bytes with public keys of 2,592 bytes.

**ML-KEM-1024** — Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism (security level 5). A NIST-standardized post-quantum key encapsulation scheme available in QoreChain's PQC algorithm registry for future encrypted communication channels.

**MLP** — Multi-Layer Perceptron. A class of neural network used by QCAI for pattern recognition in fraud detection and anomaly scoring.

**PPO** — Proximal Policy Optimization. A reinforcement learning algorithm used by PRISM to optimize chain parameters (block size, gas limits, validator set size) based on observed network conditions.

**PQC** — Post-Quantum Cryptography. Cryptographic algorithms designed to be secure against attacks from both classical and quantum computers. QoreChain implements PQC through its `x/pqc` module with ML-DSA-87 as the primary signature scheme.

**PRISM** — Policy-driven Reinforcement-learning for Intelligent State Machines. The reinforcement-learning optimization layer embedded in the QoreChain Consensus Engine (via the `x/rlconsensus` module). PRISM observes network metrics and proposes deterministic consensus-parameter adjustments under circuit-breaker safety controls. See [PRISM Consensus Engine](/architecture/prism-consensus-engine).

**PvP Rebase** — Player versus Player Rebase. A mechanism in the xQORE module where penalties from early unlock are redistributed proportionally to remaining locked stakers, rewarding long-term commitment.

**QCAI** — QoreChain Artificial Intelligence. The umbrella term for QoreChain's AI subsystem, including the on-chain heuristic engine (`x/ai` module) and the off-chain QCAI sidecar that provides advanced inference capabilities.

**QCB** — QoreChain Bridge. QoreChain's native bridge protocol for connecting to non-IBC chains (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Avalanche). QCB uses a federated validator set for cross-chain attestation. See [Bridge Architecture](/architecture/bridge-architecture).

**QDRW** — QoreChain Dynamic Reward Weighting. A governance mechanism that allows PRISM (under governance approval) to dynamically adjust reward distribution weights across validator pools, optimizing for network health metrics.

**RDK** — Rollup Development Kit. QoreChain's native framework for deploying and managing rollups with four settlement paradigms (optimistic, zk, based, sovereign), five preset profiles, and integrated data availability. See [Rollups Overview](/rollups/overview).

**RL** — Reinforcement Learning. A machine learning approach where an agent learns optimal actions through trial and reward. PRISM uses RL to dynamically tune chain parameters within the QoreChain Consensus Engine.

**RPoS** — Reputation-based Proof-of-Stake. The overarching consensus model combining DPoS delegation with reputation scoring. Validators earn reputation through uptime, participation, and community contributions, which influences their block proposal frequency.

**SHAKE-256** — A variable-output-length hash function from the SHA-3 family. QoreChain uses SHAKE-256 as its foundational hash function for PQC-related operations, including key derivation and address computation.

**SNARK** — Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge. A type of zero-knowledge proof that can be verified quickly with a small proof size. Supported as a settlement paradigm in the RDK module for zk-rollups.

**STARK** — Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge. A zero-knowledge proof system that requires no trusted setup and is quantum-resistant. Available as an alternative proof system for zk-rollup settlement in the RDK.

**SVM** — Solana Virtual Machine. A high-performance execution environment for BPF programs. QoreChain integrates the SVM as one of three supported runtimes alongside the QoreChain EVM Engine and CosmWasm.

**TEE** — Trusted Execution Environment. A secure area of a processor that ensures code and data are protected from external access. QoreChain's PQC module supports TEE attestation for key generation proofs.

**tIBE** — Threshold Identity-Based Encryption. A cryptographic scheme where a message can only be decrypted when a threshold of parties collaborate. Used by the FairBlock module to encrypt transaction contents until block finalization, preventing MEV extraction.

**uqor** — The base denomination of the QOR token. 1 QOR = 1,000,000 uqor (10^6). All on-chain amounts, fees, and staking values are denominated in uqor.

**xQORE** — The governance staking derivative of QOR. Users lock QOR to receive xQORE, which grants enhanced governance voting power and earns PvP rebase rewards from early-unlock penalties. See [Tokenomics](/architecture/tokenomics).
