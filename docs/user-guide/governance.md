# Governance

This guide covers how on-chain governance works on QoreChain, including the Quadratic Delegation-Reputation Weighted (QDRW) voting system, how to submit proposals, and how to vote.

:::note
The commands below use the **`qorechain-diana`** testnet (EVM chain ID **9800**). Mainnet (**`qorechain-vladi`**, EVM chain ID **9801**) has been live since 7 June 2026 running chain version **v3.1.80** — substitute the mainnet chain ID and endpoints from the **Connecting to Mainnet** page when participating in governance on mainnet.

## Voting Power: QDRW Formula

QoreChain uses the **Quadratic Delegation-Reputation Weighted (QDRW)** formula to calculate voting power. This system prevents whale dominance while rewarding participants who have earned high reputation scores and committed to governance through xQORE staking.

```
VP = sqrt(staked + 2 * xQORE) * ReputationMultiplier(r)
```

| Variable                  | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VP`                      | Effective voting power                                                                                                           |
| `staked`                  | Total QOR tokens staked by the voter                                                                                             |
| `xQORE`                   | Amount of xQORE governance tokens held (see [xQORE Staking](/user-guide/xqore-staking))                                          |
| `r`                       | Voter's reputation score, normalized to \[0, 1]                                                                                  |
| `ReputationMultiplier(r)` | Sigmoid function mapping reputation to a multiplier in the range \[0.5, 2.0]                                                     |

### Key Properties

* **Quadratic dampening:** A holder with 100x the stake of another voter gains only \~10x the voting power, not 100x. This ensures that governance influence scales sub-linearly with wealth.
* **xQORE bonus:** xQORE tokens count at **2x weight** inside the square root, giving governance-committed participants a meaningful advantage.
* **Reputation multiplier:** Maps the voter's reputation score from \[0, 1] to a multiplier in \[0.5, 2.0] using a sigmoid curve. High-reputation participants can double their effective voting power, while low-reputation participants see their influence halved.

## Submitting a Proposal

Any QOR holder can submit a governance proposal. A minimum deposit is required for the proposal to enter the voting period.

```bash
qorechaind tx gov submit-proposal <proposal_file.json> \
  --from mykey \
  --chain-id qorechain-diana \
  --fees 500uqor
```

**Example proposal file** (`proposal.json`):

```json
{
  "title": "Increase Maximum Validator Count",
  "description": "This proposal increases the maximum active validator set from 100 to 150 to improve decentralization.",
  "type": "parameter_change",
  "changes": [
    {
      "subspace": "staking",
      "key": "MaxValidators",
      "value": "150"
    }
  ],
  "deposit": "10000000uqor"
}
```

---

## Voting on Proposals

Once a proposal enters the voting period, any staker can cast a vote:

```bash
qorechaind tx gov vote <proposal_id> <option> \
  --from mykey \
  --chain-id qorechain-diana \
  --fees 500uqor
```

**Vote options:**

| Option         | Description                                                                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `yes`          | Support the proposal                                                                                     |
| `no`           | Oppose the proposal                                                                                      |
| `abstain`      | Acknowledge the proposal without taking a position                                                       |
| `no_with_veto` | Oppose the proposal and signal it should not have been submitted (burns the deposit if threshold is met) |

**Example:**

```bash
qorechaind tx gov vote 1 yes \
  --from mykey \
  --chain-id qorechain-diana \
  --fees 500uqor
```

## Proposal Types

QoreChain supports the following governance proposal types:

| Type                 | Description                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Text**             | A signaling proposal with no automatic on-chain execution. Used for community sentiment checks. |
| **Parameter Change** | Modifies one or more on-chain protocol parameters (e.g., max validators, emission rate).        |

## Governance Parameters

Query the current governance parameters:

Key parameters include:

| Parameter            | Description                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `min_deposit`        | Minimum deposit required for a proposal to enter voting          |
| `max_deposit_period` | Time window for reaching the minimum deposit                     |
| `voting_period`      | Duration of the voting period once a proposal is active          |
| `quorum`             | Minimum participation required for a valid vote                  |
| `threshold`          | Minimum "yes" percentage to pass (excluding abstains)            |
| `veto_threshold`     | Minimum "no with veto" percentage to reject and burn the deposit |

:::tip

* Build reputation before major governance votes to maximize your voting power multiplier.
* Lock QOR into xQORE for a 2x governance weight bonus inside the QDRW formula.
* Use `no_with_veto` carefully. If the veto threshold is reached, the proposal deposit is burned.
* Proposals that do not reach the minimum deposit within the deposit period are automatically removed.
