# Staking and Delegation

This guide covers how to delegate QOR tokens to validators, redelegate between validators, unbond your stake, claim rewards, and understand QoreChain's Triple-Pool staking architecture.

:::note
The commands below use the **`qorechain-diana`** testnet (EVM chain ID **9800**). Mainnet (**`qorechain-vladi`**, EVM chain ID **9801**) has been live since 7 June 2026 running chain version **v3.1.82** — substitute the mainnet chain ID and endpoints from the **Connecting to Mainnet** page when staking on mainnet.

## Delegating Tokens

Delegate QOR to a validator to earn staking rewards and participate in network security:

```bash
qorechaind tx staking delegate <validator_address> <amount>uqor \
  --from mykey \
  --chain-id qorechain-diana \
  --fees 500uqor
```

**Example:** Delegate 100 QOR to a validator:

```bash
qorechaind tx staking delegate qorvaloper1abc...xyz 100000000uqor \
  --from mykey \
  --chain-id qorechain-diana \
  --fees 500uqor
```

---

## Redelegating

Move your delegation from one validator to another without waiting for the unbonding period:

```bash
qorechaind tx staking redelegate <source_validator> <destination_validator> <amount>uqor \
  --from mykey \
  --chain-id qorechain-diana \
  --fees 500uqor
```

**Example:**

```bash
qorechaind tx staking redelegate qorvaloper1src... qorvaloper1dst... 50000000uqor \
  --from mykey \
  --chain-id qorechain-diana \
  --fees 500uqor
```

:::caution
You cannot redelegate tokens that are already in a redelegation transit. Wait for the current redelegation to complete before initiating another.
:::

---

## Unbonding

Withdraw your delegated tokens from a validator. Unbonding takes **21 days** to complete, during which the tokens do not earn rewards and cannot be transferred.

```bash
qorechaind tx staking unbond <validator_address> <amount>uqor \
  --from mykey \
  --chain-id qorechain-diana \
  --fees 500uqor
```

**Example:**

```bash
qorechaind tx staking unbond qorvaloper1abc...xyz 25000000uqor \
  --from mykey \
  --chain-id qorechain-diana \
  --fees 500uqor
```

After the 21-day unbonding period, tokens are automatically returned to your account.

---

## Claiming Rewards

Withdraw all accumulated staking rewards from every validator you have delegated to:

```bash
qorechaind tx distribution withdraw-all-rewards \
  --from mykey \
  --chain-id qorechain-diana \
  --fees 500uqor
```

To withdraw rewards from a specific validator only:

```bash
qorechaind tx distribution withdraw-rewards <validator_address> \
  --from mykey \
  --chain-id qorechain-diana \
  --fees 500uqor
```

Staking rewards are funded from the protocol's 590M QOR staking pool under the Tokenomics v2.1 schedule, alongside the staker share (10%) of every transaction fee.

## Triple-Pool Classification

QoreChain uses a **Triple-Pool** staking model that classifies validators into three pools based on their reputation and delegation levels. Each pool receives a weighted share of block rewards.

| Pool                                 | Entry Criteria                                              | Reward Weight |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **RPoS** (Reputation Proof of Stake) | Reputation score >= 70th percentile **AND** stake >= median | 40%           |
| **DPoS** (Delegated Proof of Stake)  | Total delegation >= 10,000 QOR                              | 35%           |
| **PoS** (Proof of Stake)             | All remaining validators                                    | 25%           |

Validators are reclassified at every epoch boundary. A validator that builds a strong reputation and accumulates sufficient stake is promoted to the RPoS pool, earning the highest reward share.

## Bonding Curve Rewards

Individual staking rewards are computed using QoreChain's bonding curve formula:

```
R = beta * S * (1 + alpha * log(1 + L)) * Q(r) * P(t)
```

| Variable | Description                                                          |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `R`      | Reward amount for the period                                         |
| `beta`   | Base reward rate (protocol parameter)                                |
| `S`      | Staked amount                                                        |
| `alpha`  | Loyalty coefficient (protocol parameter)                             |
| `L`      | Lock duration in epochs                                              |
| `Q(r)`   | Quality multiplier derived from the validator's reputation score `r` |
| `P(t)`   | Pool multiplier at time `t` (40%, 35%, or 25% depending on pool)     |

Longer lock durations and higher reputation scores result in proportionally greater rewards, incentivizing long-term commitment and good validator behavior.

## Querying Validator Information

Look up details about any validator:

```bash
qorechaind query staking validator <validator_operator_address>
```

**Example:**

```bash
qorechaind query staking validator qorvaloper1abc...xyz
```

List all active validators:

```bash
qorechaind query staking validators --status bonded
```

Query your current delegations:

```bash
qorechaind query staking delegations <delegator_address>
```

---

:::tip

* Delegating to validators in the **RPoS pool** yields the highest rewards due to the 40% pool weight.
* Building validator reputation takes time. Consider the validator's track record before delegating.
* Redelegation is instant but has cooldown restrictions. Plan your moves carefully.
* The 21-day unbonding period is a security measure. During this time, slashing events can still affect your tokens.
