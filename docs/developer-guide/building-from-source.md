# Building from Source

This guide walks you through building the `qorechaind` binary from source, covering both the community (open-core) build and the full proprietary build.

## Prerequisites

| Dependency         | Minimum Version           | Notes                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Go**             | 1.26+                     | Required for all builds                           |
| **CGO**            | Enabled (`CGO_ENABLED=1`) | Required for PQC and SVM FFI bridges              |
| **Rust toolchain** | Latest stable             | Required to compile `libqorepqc` and `libqoresvm` |
| **Make**           | 3.81+                     | Build automation                                  |
| **Git**            | 2.x                       | Source checkout                                   |

Verify your environment:

```bash
go version        # go1.26.x or later
rustc --version   # stable toolchain
cargo --version
echo $CGO_ENABLED # must be 1
```

:::danger
Every `go build`, `go test`, and `go run` invocation **must** have `CGO_ENABLED=1` set. The PQC and SVM modules use FFI bridges that require cgo.
:::

## Native Libraries

QoreChain depends on two Rust-built native libraries that are loaded at runtime.

### libqorepqc (Post-Quantum Cryptography)

The PQC library provides ML-DSA-87 (Dilithium-5) key generation, signing, and verification through a C-compatible FFI interface.

```bash
cd rust/qorepqc
cargo build --release
```

The compiled library is placed in `lib/{os}_{arch}/`:

| Platform    | Library File       | Directory           |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| macOS arm64 | `libqorepqc.dylib` | `lib/darwin_arm64/` |
| Linux amd64 | `libqorepqc.so`    | `lib/linux_amd64/`  |
| Linux arm64 | `libqorepqc.so`    | `lib/linux_arm64/`  |

### libqoresvm (SVM Runtime)

The SVM library provides the BPF program execution environment for the x/svm module.

```bash
cd rust/qoresvm
cargo build --release
```

Output follows the same `lib/{os}_{arch}/` convention as above (`libqoresvm.dylib` on macOS, `libqoresvm.so` on Linux).

### Setting the Library Path

The native libraries must be discoverable at runtime. Set the appropriate environment variable for your platform:

**macOS:**

```bash
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/lib/darwin_arm64:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

**Linux:**

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/lib/linux_amd64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

:::info
Tip: Add the export to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`) so it persists across sessions.

## Open-Core Architecture

QoreChain follows an **open-core** model:

* **Community build** — Contains the full module interfaces, CLI commands, protobuf definitions, and message types for every QoreChain module (x/pqc, x/ai, x/reputation, x/qca, x/svm, x/crossvm, etc.). Keepers for proprietary modules use **stub implementations** that return safe defaults or no-op responses. This allows third-party tooling, wallets, and indexers to integrate with all QoreChain APIs without requiring proprietary code.
* **Full (proprietary) build** — Enables the complete keeper implementations behind the `proprietary` build tag. This includes the real AI anomaly detection logic, PRISM consensus parameter tuning, advanced reputation scoring, and all production-grade features.

Both builds produce the same `qorechaind` binary name and expose identical CLI commands and gRPC/REST endpoints. The difference is in the runtime behavior of the keeper logic behind those interfaces.

## Community Build

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o qorechaind ./cmd/qorechaind/
```

This compiles all public module interfaces with stub keepers for proprietary features. The resulting binary is fully functional for:

* Running a validator node
* Submitting and querying transactions
* Interacting with EVM, CosmWasm, and SVM VMs
* Building third-party integrations and tooling
* Local development and testing

## Full Build (Proprietary)

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -tags proprietary -o qorechaind ./cmd/qorechaind/
```

The `-tags proprietary` flag activates the full keeper implementations, which are not part of the public source tree.

## Running Tests

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test ./... -count=1
```

The `-count=1` flag disables test caching, ensuring a clean run every time. Individual package tests can be run with:

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test ./x/pqc/... -count=1 -v
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test ./x/ai/... -count=1 -v
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test ./x/svm/... -count=1 -v
```

Run the Rust library tests separately:

```bash
cd rust/qorepqc && cargo test
cd rust/qoresvm && cargo test
```

## Build Verification

After a successful build, verify the binary:

```bash
./qorechaind version
./qorechaind init test-node --chain-id qorechain-diana
```

The `init` command should create a genesis file and node configuration in `~/.qorechaind/` without errors. The example above initializes against the **`qorechain-diana`** testnet — for mainnet, substitute `--chain-id qorechain-vladi`, the live network running chain version **v3.1.82**.

## Docker Build

For containerized builds, a Dockerfile is provided at the repository root:

```bash
docker build -t qorechaind:latest .
```

The Docker image handles all native library compilation and path configuration automatically. See the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) guide for running a node with Docker Compose.

## Troubleshooting

<details>

<summary>cgo: C compiler not found</summary>

Install Xcode CLI tools (macOS) or `build-essential` (Linux)

</details>

<details>

<summary>cannot find -lqorepqc</summary>

Build the Rust libraries first and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` / `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`

</details>

<details>

<summary>undefined: sonic.*</summary>

Ensure `go.sum` is up to date: `go mod tidy`

</details>

<details>

<summary>signal: killed during build</summary>

Increase available memory (common in Docker with low limits)

</details>

<details>

<summary>PQC tests fail with size mismatch</summary>

Verify you are using `pqcrypto v0.5.0+` (ML-DSA-87: pubkey=2592, privkey=4896, sig=4627 bytes)
