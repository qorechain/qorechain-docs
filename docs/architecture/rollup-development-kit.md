# Rollup Development Kit

The `x/rdk` module provides a comprehensive Rollup Development Kit (RDK) that allows developers to deploy application-specific rollups on QoreChain. It supports four settlement paradigms, multiple sequencer modes, pluggable data availability backends, and AI-assisted configuration optimization.

---

## Settlement Paradigms

QoreChain RDK supports four distinct settlement modes — **optimistic**, **zk**, **based**, and **sovereign** — each with different trust assumptions, finality characteristics, and proof requirements.

### Optimistic Settlement

Optimistic rollups assume transactions are valid by default and rely on fraud proofs for dispute resolution.

* **Proof system**: Interactive fraud proofs
* **Challenge window**: 7 days (604,800 seconds), configurable per rollup
* **Challenge bond**: 1,000 QOR (1,000,000,000 uqor) — required to submit a fraud proof challenge
* **Finality**: Delayed until the challenge window expires with no valid challenge
* **Auto-finalization**: The `EndBlocker` automatically finalizes batches once the challenge window has passed without dispute

**Batch lifecycle**:

```
Submitted → [challenge window expires] → Finalized
Submitted → [fraud proof submitted] → Challenged → Rejected
```

### ZK (Zero-Knowledge) Settlement

ZK rollups provide cryptographic validity proofs that guarantee state transition correctness.

* **Proof system**: SNARK (Groth16, PLONK) or STARK (transparent, no trusted setup)
* **Finality**: Instant on proof verification — no challenge window required
* **Max proof size**: 1 MB (1,048,576 bytes)
* **Recursion depth**: Configurable proof aggregation depth (default: 1)
* **Maturity**: In the current release, ZK settlement uses stub verification that accepts any non-empty proof. Full SNARK/STARK proof verification is a planned upgrade and should be treated as not yet production-hardened.

**Batch lifecycle**:

```
Submitted + valid proof → Finalized (instant)
```

### Based Settlement

Based rollups delegate transaction sequencing to L1 (QoreChain) proposers, inheriting the host chain's liveness and censorship resistance guarantees.

* **Proof system**: None required — L1 proposers are the source of truth
* **Sequencer**: Must use `based` sequencer mode (enforced by validation)
* **Finality**: 2-block confirmation on QoreChain
* **Inclusion delay**: Configurable blocks before forced inclusion of rollup transactions
* **Priority fee sharing**: Configurable percentage of priority fees paid to L1 proposers

**Batch lifecycle**:

```
Submitted → [2 L1 blocks] → Finalized (auto)
```

### Sovereign Settlement

Sovereign rollups operate with independent consensus and self-sequence their transactions. They anchor state to QoreChain for verifiability but do not depend on the host chain for finality.

* **Proof system**: None
* **Finality**: Independent — determined by the rollup's own consensus
* **State anchoring**: State roots are posted to QoreChain for transparency and verifiability, but are not enforced
* **Auto-finalization**: None — sovereign rollups manage their own finality

## Proof System Compatibility

| Settlement Mode | Fraud Proofs |     SNARK |     STARK |     None |
| --------------- | -----------: | --------: | --------: | -------: |
| **Optimistic**  |     Required |        -- |        -- |       -- |
| **ZK**          |           -- | Supported | Supported |       -- |
| **Based**       |           -- |        -- |        -- | Required |
| **Sovereign**   |           -- |        -- |        -- | Required |

STARK and full ZK proof verification are still maturing; see the [ZK Settlement](#zk-zero-knowledge-settlement) maturity note above.

## Preset Profiles

The RDK ships **five preset profiles** that provide turnkey rollup configurations optimized for common use cases. Each preset bundles a settlement mode, sequencer mode, data availability backend, and execution parameters tuned for its target domain:

| Profile       | Target Use Case                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`defi`**    | Decentralized finance: trading, lending, and AMM-style applications |
| **`gaming`**  | High-throughput, low-latency game state and in-game economies       |
| **`nft`**     | NFT minting, marketplaces, and digital collectibles                 |
| **`social`**  | Social and content applications with frequent lightweight actions   |
| **`general`** | A balanced, general-purpose default for mixed workloads             |

The specific settlement mode, VM, block time, and fee parameters bundled into each preset are subject to change as the RDK matures; consult the live module parameters for the authoritative per-preset configuration. Developers can also select a **Custom** configuration and set every parameter individually.

---

## Sequencer Modes

The sequencer determines who orders transactions within a rollup block.

### Dedicated Sequencer

A single operator sequences all rollup transactions.

* **Operator**: Single designated address
* **Latency**: Lowest possible — single-party ordering
* **Trust**: Requires trust in the sequencer operator for liveness and fair ordering

### Shared Sequencer

A set of sequencers collectively order transactions.

* **Minimum set size**: Configurable (default: 1)
* **Latency**: Slightly higher due to multi-party coordination
* **Trust**: Distributed across the sequencer set

### Based Sequencer

QoreChain L1 proposers sequence rollup transactions.

* **Inclusion delay**: Configurable blocks before forced inclusion (default: 10)
* **Priority fee share**: Configurable percentage of priority fees paid to L1 proposers
* **Trust**: Inherits QoreChain's validator set security and censorship resistance
* **Requirement**: Based settlement mode requires the based sequencer (enforced at validation)

## Data Availability Backends

### Native DA

On-chain KV-store blob storage within QoreChain itself.

| Parameter            | Value                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Max blob size**    | 2 MB (2,097,152 bytes)                                                                              |
| **Retention period** | 432,000 blocks (\~30 days at 6-second blocks)                                                       |
| **Auto-pruning**     | Expired blobs are pruned in the `EndBlocker` — data is removed but commitment metadata is retained  |
| **Commitment**       | SHA-256 hash of blob data                                                                           |

### Celestia DA

IBC-based data availability using Celestia's dedicated DA layer.

* **Status**: Stubbed in the current release — returns an error if selected as the sole backend
* **Namespace support**: Rollup-specific namespaces are supported in the blob schema
* **Planned**: Full IBC integration with Celestia's blob submission and verification

### Both (Redundant)

Stores blobs on both Native and Celestia backends simultaneously.

* In the current release, only the native blob is actually stored; a warning is logged for the Celestia component.

## Rollup Lifecycle

```
Pending → Active → Paused → Active → Stopped
                      ↑                  |
                      └──────────────────┘
                      (can resume from paused,
                       stopped is permanent)
```

| State       | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pending** | Rollup registered but not yet activated                      |
| **Active**  | Rollup is live and processing batches                        |
| **Paused**  | Temporarily halted by creator (can resume)                   |
| **Stopped** | Permanently decommissioned — stake bond returned to creator  |

On creation, rollup status is set to `Active` immediately after stake escrow and layer registration succeed.

---

## Batch Lifecycle

Settlement batches track the state progression of rollup state roots:

```
Submitted → Finalized                              (happy path)
Submitted → Challenged → Rejected                  (fraud detected)
```

| State          | Description                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Submitted**  | Batch posted to QoreChain, awaiting finalization  |
| **Challenged** | Fraud proof challenge submitted (optimistic only) |
| **Finalized**  | Batch accepted as canonical                       |
| **Rejected**   | Batch invalidated by successful challenge         |

### Auto-Finalization Rules

| Settlement Mode | Finalization Trigger                                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Optimistic**  | Challenge window expires (\~7 days) with no valid challenge |
| **ZK**          | Instant on valid proof submission                           |
| **Based**       | 2 L1 blocks after submission                                |
| **Sovereign**   | None — managed by the rollup's own consensus                |

Auto-finalization is executed in the `EndBlocker` for optimistic and based rollups. ZK batches are finalized inline during batch submission.

---

## Multilayer Integration

The RDK module integrates with `x/multilayer` for cross-layer state management:

### Layer Registration

When a rollup is created, it is automatically registered as a sidechain layer via `RegisterSidechain`. The registration includes:

* Layer ID (matches rollup ID)
* Target block time and max transactions per block
* Supported VM types and domains
* Settlement interval

Registration is **non-fatal**: if `x/multilayer` registration fails, the rollup is still created and a warning is logged.

### State Anchoring

Every settlement batch submitted to the RDK is anchored to `x/multilayer` via `AnchorState`. This records:

* Layer ID and layer height (batch index)
* State root
* Transaction count

Anchoring is **non-fatal**: failures are logged but do not prevent batch processing.

---

## Burn Integration

On rollup creation, **1% of the stake amount** is burned via the `x/burn` module through the `rollup_create` burn channel. For example, creating a rollup with the minimum 10,000 QOR stake burns 100 QOR permanently. The remaining 9,900 QOR is held in escrow and returned when the rollup is stopped.
